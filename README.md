# conio.h-for-linux
"getch" and "getche" for Linux

If you're having a problem with getch and getche on Linux, this might fix your problem.

To implement it in your libraries, copy conio.h to /usr/include
You can do it by typing this in terminal:
# cd ~/Downloads
# sudo mv conio.h /usr/include

You can also edit file and implement other functions from conio.h, but I don't need them, so I won't bother with writing them.
I only need "getch" and "getche" for my school.

Special thanks to Shobhit and Isaac from Stack Overflow for writing this code.
